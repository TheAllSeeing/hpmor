    The text contains many clues for its mysteries: obvious clues, not-so-obvious clues,
    truly obscure hints which I was shocked to see some readers successfully decode,
    and massive evidence left out in plain sight. This is a rationalist story;
    its mysteries are solvable, and meant to be solved.

    All science mentioned is real science. But please keep in mind that, beyond the
    realm of science, the views of the characters may not be those of the author.
    Not everything the protagonist does is a lesson in wisdom, and advice offered by
    darker characters may be untrustworthy or dangerously double-edged.
