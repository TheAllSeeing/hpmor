Dumbledore peered over his desk at young Harry, twinkling in a kindly sort of

conditions for both the presence and the absence of the phenomenon, and I've
determined that my scar hurts if and only if I'm facing the back of Professor
Quirrell's head, whatever's under his turban. While it \emph{could} be
something more innocuous, I think we should provisionally assume the worst,
that it's You-Know-Who—wait, don't look so horrified, this is actually a
priceless opportunity—"
