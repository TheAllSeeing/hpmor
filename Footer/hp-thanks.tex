    This story was composed and written by Eliezer Yudkowsky; You can find the full original text including
    his author's notes and audience discussion at \url{http://hpmor.com}, where it was originally posted
    chapter-by-chapter. Other works by him (both stories and essays) can be found across social media and
    on the LessWrong forum.

    This story was inspired by and utilized the setting and characters of the \emph{Harry Potter} book series by
    J.K Rowling, though much of its world and many of its characters are significantly divergent to it.

    This book is \emph{not} an official publication, and is the culmination of much work by many fans of the
    story.

    The cover's colorscheme and numbering style is taken from \href{https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/hpmor}{%
    cover art by Ian Storm Taylor}. The concept for the back cover \ifnum\hpBookNo=1\else and its artwork\fi%
    was taken from \href{https://github.com/knuesel/hpmor\#covers}{cover art by Lily Yao Lu}\ifnum\hpBookNo=5 ,%
    who also created the front cover art\fi. \ifnum\hpBookNo=2 The front cover artwork was %

    \href{https://twitter.com/trumangracee/status/940917751769579521}{user trumangracee on twitter}. \fi%
    The front cover concept was inspired by user phaedrus2000 who \href{https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/70sug6/yet_another_set_of_printed_books/dn6e1ew/}{%
    posted his own covers on reddit}, and subsequently tweaked by user ForeChin99, who
    merged all the above styles \href{https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/hvlhkm/trying_to_make_my_own_book_covers_am_i_winning/}{ %
    and posted their version on reddit}. That version became the nigh-final for this book, with additional tweaks
    made by Atai Ambus, including changes to the format of the front cover\ifnum\FrontArtChanged=1{} and its artwork \fi
    \ifnum\QuoteChanged=1\ and changes to the back-cover quote\ifnum\BackArtChanged=1{} and artwork\fi\fi.

    The content of the book itself present the fifth revision of the text's adaptation into book form.
    The original document was made by \href{https://github.com/bogdanb/hpmor}{user bodanb on github}
    and put on the HPMOR site, and was later revised by \href{https://github.com/rjl20/hpmor}{Josh Larios},
    \href{https://github.com/xenohedron/hpmor-xetex}{Blaise Whiteshell}, \href{https://github.com/knuesel/hpmor}{Jeremie Knuesel}
    and lastly, \href{https://github.com/TheAllSeeing/hpmor}{Atai Ambus}. Each had carefully corrected textual
    errors (such as typos and grammer erros), and edited the book's typography (adjusting kerning, linebreaks and
    titling) and structure (such as the inclusion and position of author's notes, epigraphs and extra content).
    The result before you is a merge of all their great work according to the preferences of the last reviser.

    This book was typeset using the \LaTeX\ system, and utilized the fonts \texttt{URW~Garamond~No.~8} and \texttt{Lumos}.

    The full source code for generating a PDF version of this book, as well as sources for the cover art and
    a complete repository of all the sources and inspirations mentioned above as well as other major PDF and
    cover versions made by the \emph{Methods of Rationality} fanbase, can be found on
